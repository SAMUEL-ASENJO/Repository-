1. 
```{r}
HouseHoldData <- data.frame (
  ShoeSize = c(6.5, 9.0, 8.5, 8.5, 10.5, 7.0, 9.5, 9.0, 13.0, 7.5, 10.5, 8.5, 12.0, 10.5, 13.0, 11.5, 8.5, 5.0, 10.0, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, 10.5, 8.5, 10.5,  11.0, 9.0, 13.0),

HouseHoldData
```
a. The data shows that it has three columns namely, shoesize, height and, gender with 28 rows.


b. 
```{r}
s <- subset(HouseHoldData, Gender == "M" & ShoeSize&Height)
s

s2 <- subset(HouseHoldData, Gender == "F" & ShoeSize&Height)
s2
```
c. 
```{r}

sm <- mean(HouseHoldData$ShoeSize)
sm

hm <- mean(HouseHoldData$Height)
hm
```
d. No, because there are some respondents that is taller but has smaller shoe size that others who are shorter.
